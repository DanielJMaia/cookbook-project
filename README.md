Errors Encountered: Clashing between Materialize styles and my own. 
Initializing materialize elements wasn't always working.
The for loop that populates the navbar doesn't function at the same time as the for loop that populates index.html. No idea why.
The categories dropdown on the add recipe page also breaks when the for loop gets introduced to the base html page. 
How to do environment variables?
Can't use jinja in JS, so I had to improvise for the delete button which uses sweetalert
